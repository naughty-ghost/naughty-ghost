## About Me
会社員です。個人開発も行っています。ウェブアプリケーションの開発、特にバックエンドが中心です。
REST APIの設計開発やメッセージキューを利用した非同期ワーカーの開発が得意です。API連携が可能なサービスを自サービスに組み込むのも得意です。

最近は、認証やID連携とソフトウェアテストの勉強中です。

I'm a software engineer who loves working on personal projects in my spare time. My main focus is on the backend side of web development.

My expertise lies in building REST APIs and developing asynchronous workers with message queues. I also enjoy integrating various third-party API services into my own apps.

Lately, I've been diving into authentication, identity federation, and software testing.
